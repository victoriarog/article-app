## About The Project

ArticleApp is a ReactJS application that contains the list and a detailed view of articles, pulled from dummy data JSON. 

From the list of article titles, an article can be chosen to be open in a more detailed view to read its contents. Once the article is clicked, it is marked as read by changing the background colour of the title container. 

Search bar on the top of the page can be used to look for a specific article through any word in its title, subtitle or content.
